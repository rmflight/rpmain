At the honest age of 6 my daughter look at my dissertation and called it 'Boring.' She wasn't wrong. I've decided to create a novel in which I turn the boring dissertation into a story about alien colonialism. 

['Symbiosis'](https://rmflight.github.io/symbiosisnovel) is a story about a war between three colonizers:
* Ks'ou, the parasites who failed at colonizing humans and have begun once more with a new, more subtle plan.
* Thhiyatkhoor, the great warriors who saved humans from their fate in the first wave of Ks'ou-Human colonization.
* And humans, of course, who have always been very skilled at colonizing one another.

A related short story is 'Days Without War'.
