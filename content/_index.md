# Who am I?

Rivière Parley is the pseudonym for a professor of Literature, Language, and Pedagogy somewhere on kyôsta l-Earth (also known as elu-sthii) Earth. Much of the content of the Symbiosis Series, whether direct or not, is informed by the horrors of her dissertation, which (broadly) addresses African colonization, race, identity politics, and (socio)linguistics. She likes sci-fi, afrofuturism, and learning languages.

# What Am I Writing?

I am *slowly* writing the book Symbiosis, which can be accessed [here](https://rmflight.github.io/symbiosisnovel).

A related short story is 'Days Without War'.
