# First, Thank You.

I give gratitude to Leilani Serafin, my avid reader who has offered insights and advice beyond my imagination. It takes a remarkable person to find an editor who "gets you," but also offers critical feedback that refines you.

# Who am I?

Rivière Parley is the pseudonym for a professor of Literature, Language, and Pedagogy somewhere on kyôsta l-Earth (also known as elu-sthii) Earth. Much of the content of the Symbiosis Series, whether direct or not, is informed by the horrors of her dissertation, which (broadly) addresses African colonization, race, identity politics, and (socio)linguistics. She likes sci-fi, afrofuturism, and learning languages.

# Buy me coffee?

Like lots of folk, I am broke. I write this on my own free time, mostly at night or on the weekends, while I try to figure out how to pay all the loan debt accumulated during the PhD. A little support will definitely not hurt, and give me a little hope! Here's my CashApp link!
