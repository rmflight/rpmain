>“Flesh describes an alien entity, a more or less expendable figure…  
>its most poignant determination is the extent to which such a body cannot prevent or ward off another's touch. 
>The single-most powerful evidence of the loss of freedom is the fact that bodies lose their integrity and may be >invaded or entered… by coercive power. 
>This touch that we associate with intimacy… becomes instead the power to wound and violate.”

They were beautiful; I would destroy them.

The planet of the newly discovered creatures, the *Olyat-Koi*, appeared in the screen before me and my team of warrior-Settlers. It was small, with only one continent visible from the exosphere where we lay in wait, and these aliens as I had come to understand them seemed placable enough. Trained in intercepting and decoding messages, I happened upon a *Thhiyatkhoor* transmission which had given these coordinates. Under the guise to my superiors that I was making a simple investigation, a curiosity about a planet I heard about by rumor, I set a course for the *Olyat-Koi* homeworld. I didn’t want any nosy overseers following and trying to take over what was rightfully my discovery.

If the *Thhiyatkhoor* were here, they would be so peacefully, as the messages had indicated. I wanted to know what they were doing, and if these new creatures were suitable for settling.

In the corner, the short, bipedal creature, with tan flesh and a black nest shooting from its head, began to whimper. The creature, a gift from one of my allies and confidantes, was designated to be used for research missions. But a Commander could use research for only one thing. 

The whimpering grew louder. Why now? I needed to concentrate. “||*Quiet that thing*||,” I hissed. Not even my own shell of a settled made such noise as this mewling thing had since the transfer had been made to this ship. A soldier, in an elongated body pinched at the waist, raised one of its weapons, but the ensuing clatter into short creature’s skull would not come. I took one immediate leap and slammed the soldier’s head into the wall, pushing so that a trickle of dark blue blood began to emit from its ears: “||*I did not say kill it. I need that thing for my project. Are you trying to sabotage me*||?”

“Adê (No),” the soldier whimpered. It sounded as pathetic as the little creature, now, who had quietened and was looking up at us both with widened eyes. I calculated: I could not afford to lose another soldier, nor was it worth losing patience over what amounted to mere vibrations in the air. I released him so he would slide to the floor. To the short thing I said, “||*Carry on your irritating and arbitrary noise-making*||,” knowing that the stupid thing didn’t understand my language. This would be remedied when I released my current creature and Settled the small one, connecting to its neural pathways as I was biologically designed to do. But not yet.

As if on cue it began making noises again. I conceded that if I were as small as it, with so much exposed flesh despite the long sheet of thin fabric covering from just below the head to its lower body, I would perhaps have cause for worry, too. The Ks’ou and it were not much different in that respect—our bodies are vulnerable, unlike the hardened, mosaic bodies of the multitudinously-formed creature I currently possessed, or—I thought this with an inward joy as I turned my attention back to the screen—the *Olyat-Koi*, whose bodies were as formidable and strong as their minds. The best hosts were sharp in both, as these were rich resources that the Ks’ou could mine for our own purposes. Lost in the thought of finally landing on the planet, executing the plan, and retrieving the exemplar, I was able to push away the sound of the short creature’s bleats as my mind flooded with images of conquest.

This would be a day, perhaps, named after me for celebration. I was saving the *Olyat-Koi* from their illusions of peace. I would bring the galaxy to them, to hold them honorable above all other species. 









In case you were wondering: there are no heroes in this story. There are those who do heroic acts, and there are moments of courage. Do not consider any of us heroes; we are all only villains until the very moment of our dying breath, until our being is taken into account.
