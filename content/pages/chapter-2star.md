*Ana Joseph and Aurana~*

*Spring PsKE 39, 2—-*

*Dr. Hagåtña*
	
*A Brief History of Human Colonization*

*‘Chronotope’ (Time-Space) is a theory by the ancient Russian thinker M. M. Bakhtin (citation needed). He argues that Narration can be looked at separately through the lense of these two different relationships: temporal (time) and spatial (space). These two components express a particular worldview or ideology depending on the genre of literature you find it in. [is this sentence necessary?] However, the time and space components of chronotope are not easily separated, and I will argue that this unsettling connection between time and space shows the ways that colonization has unsettled [try 'disrupted’—less weird, you know…] Human civilization since the beginning of time. Colonizers aim to dominate and reconfigure the chronotope of other cultures and peoples. [yes.] Though there are varying types of colonization, if there is one tenet that all colonization shares, it is this…*


Professor Hagåtña[^4] lifted her eyes from the paper to gaze at Ana directly. The professor’s brown eyes contrasted well with the dark green rims of her glasses, framed by curly black hair and skin like saturated elm. “Seems a little ambitious for a senior capstone.”

Ana tried not to feel small. Mama and Papa Joseph taught her to be fairly comfortable in this minute academic world, but Dr. Hagåtña was sharp and serious, someone who did smile on occasion, only when she intended to and usually at her own humor. There were other differences in this world, too: Ana tried to hide her shoes beneath the chair, they would not last through winter but the duct tape should hold up for a few more weeks as long as it didn’t snow too often. She took care to keep the upper half of her body presentable, wearing a dark blue blazer and keeping her braids tidy and tight, as Mama taught. 

“I’d like to think of it as a lifetime project. I would just lay out the groundwork for this class, get started, you know.” She needed this project approved so she wouldn’t have to work with Dr. Jayco. Dr. Hagåtña was one of few professors at the University who looked somewhat similarly to Ana, and the only one who likely had enough savvy to know how she could navigate it.

Dr. Hagåtña’s eyes dropped again as she surveyed the summary that Ana had hastily typed out that morning on her Univ-pod, having forgotten the assignment was due at all. Aurana had to follow through and make corrections, all too late. The reminder from her Ks'ou was one of many times she was grateful to be co-inhabited—a nagging voice who would help her recall all she’d forgotten. 

{ You’d do better if you would just update your calendar, } Aurana hissed. { Why are Humans so terrible at time? It would take one minute, of which you have 960 per average waking— }

{ Shhh! You’re not supposed to read my mind! }

{ I’m not. You think as loudly as you speak. And no one has ever referred to you as quiet, if I recall. }

{ Shhhh! }

Ana blinked. Dr. Hagåtña was staring at her curiously. She must have said something that Ana hadn’t heard in the outer-body aloud. “I… I’m sorry, Professor. Could you repeat the question?”

Her professor’s eyebrows raised, slightly, lifting her spectacles just up over the ridges of the wrinkles on her forehead. She repeated, “Who is Aurana?”

Ana gulped. She had insisted that the very Ks’ou who controlled her body be included in the authorship, because of the archive. Without thinking about having to explain what the name was doing there in the first place. “My sister.”

“You’ve referred to her as Éloise in the times you’ve mentioned her in class.”

Curse her formidable memory! Ana thought quickly. “It is. But that was my nickname for her. A joke. She was born seconds after me. So I started calling her After-Ana, A-r-ana. The name stuck.”

{ …what an excellent lie. } Aurana mused, impressed.

Ana felt somewhat self-satisfied, too, when she noticed how Dr. Hagåtña nodded, the slight curve of the corners of her mouth peaking. “Clever.” The curves disappeared. “But why is she a co-author?”

“My… I talk with my sister about it.”

“With?” 

“I mean to. I talk to her. She doesn’t talk back, obviously.”

“Obviously.” 

Ana was beginning to despite that word. “But I really want her to be on there. She’s helped me so much. I wouldn’t be here if she didn’t urge me to attend college. And we’ve always talked about colonization with each other. So she should get credit.”

“If only more academics thought as you did,” Dr. Hagåtña muttered dryly. “You wrote and tried, desperately, to edit this at the last minute, I see. Let me read through and see if I can piece together something logical out of these syntactic disasters.”

Ana held her breath, waiting for the professor’s final answer. In the silence she began to fumble around with the cotton gloves in her lap, the kind that were open halfway so that her fingers poked through. When she tried them on and wiggled her fingers in, Aurana had joked that the gloves made it look as though she had tendrils just as her own.  

Tendrils was the word that they had finally decided on; ‘tentacles’ was the word that Aurana first used, but Ana had to correct her, arguing that they had a creepy undertone.

{ Appendages, then, } Aurana had said. She had very little patience for the richness of the English language, and a particularly unhealthy disdain for synonyms.

{ That’s also a weird word. }

{ Why do Humans make perfectly fine words into oddities? They are simply words, they point to a thing and that is all. Weird words are arbitrary! }

{ Let’s just say tendrils. Tendrils sound nice. Like tender. }

{ *Arbitrary.* } Aurana had insisted again.

Dr. Hagåtña finally finished decorating Ana’s paper with the blood-red violence of semi-constructive criticism. She handed it back; Ana could breathe. *Approved with major adjustments* was scribbled across the top. Her mother would be proud; she couldn’t wait to tell her, imagined her round and shining arms lifting up energy into the air, “Kreyol: ||Nou pa sèl ki ka fonn pa lapli[^5]!||” Aurana was ecstatic and weary at once.

“You’re a promising student, and it will be a necessary contribution to the field, as long as you give yourself parameters,” the professor said. “Give me something more concrete—and not written at the last minute—by next week’s class.”

“Thank you, Dr. Hagåtña,” Ana said, shoving the paper into her backpack and standing to leave. 

“Ana…” 

Ana grimaced. She hoped her professor would just return to her screen as she normally did, with that distant look in her eyes indicating that her mind had already shifted to other pressing abstractions. This was the third professor who had spoken to her in that tone of voice. 

“I am concerned about your engagement in this class,” she said. “You are often distracted. You hesitate to speak though it is clear you have much to say. Is there something about the class that is disappointing you?”

Dr. Hagåtña usually framed things in the context that mattered most to her. 

“It’s not the class,” Ana forced a thin smile to show she was genuine. Of course, she couldn’t tell her professor about the alien currently residing in the interstices of her brain, the alien whose appenda—*ahem*, tendrils—had curled and curved their way from the cerebral cortex up through the synapses. The alien who lay unseen, except for a small bump on her neck hidden by the scarf she wore, but listening in to this very conversation. “I’m engaged, promise.”

“I’m not allowed to make assumptions, but I can say that having difficulty concentrating could indicate a larger problem. If you need resources, I can direct you to Mentality Services, or the Abilities Office. They serve all species—”

Ana grimaced inwardly; chewed her lip. She drew back and Aurana did not miss a beat, taking over her Human’s mouth, “Dr. Hagåtña, I am Human, and I am just fine. Last week you reframed James Baldwin’s *Talk to Teachers* in our context today. That 2—- is a time where we are at a further loss for our identities because we couldn’t figure out who we were, we couldn’t figure out our vision for ourselves as a species, before aliens came. Writing this book *is* my vision for humans. If I can configure colonization in Human’s past, then we can contend with the resonances of the Ks’ou’s failed attempt at colonization today.”

{ Applause-worthy elevator speech. }

{ Perhaps it *is* time you pay better attention in class. }

{ Yep. Mmm.. noted. }

Dr. Hagåtña was smiling at her—if only the professor knew she was smiling at two beings at once. While her eyes were direct, she made a motion with her lips as though wanting to say something, but chose not to respond directly. “Good day, then.” The distant look in her eyes pulled her away and she turned towards the books on her shelves, as though Aurana were never there. 

Aurana was fairly certain that the professor wasn’t inhabited, but she always wore a high collar, and in winter when everyone’s necks was covered for warmth, one could never really know—unless you had access to the Ks’ou database. That would require an unnecessary hacking, and their time was occupied plenty by other, more necessary ones. 

Aurana sent a small trill through their shared minds. { A co-author! This is exciting. We are making a text! I’ll be the first published *Ks’ou*! }

{ It’s just a school project. It’s not a big deal, } Ana reminded her, but she took one look out the window and finished relinquishing to Aurana. They were headed outside, where it had, to Ana’s chagrin and the ultimate destruction of her boots, began to snow. Aurana hated the cold, but she was fascinated by ‘solid water’, liked to saunter through it. By the time they had finished pushing open the doors to the outside, Aurana now controlled her entire body, not just her mouth as the final moments back in the professor’s office. Ana, though she was still able to see, did not have to feel a hint of cold. 

They headed towards their next class, a certain Professor Jayco who was far less intimidating—but also less interesting—than Dr. Hagåtña. { Still. A book that needs to be written. Humans and your lack of knowledge. Why does it take alien colonization for you to set yourselves straight? } 

{ Pot. Kettle. } 

{ A fair point, } Aurana grumbled, but Ana could always hear that small hint of admiration in her voice, a tone that resonated even as they spoke through each other’s minds.
It was snowing more heavily now, the kind of abundant snow that populated the campus grounds in heaps and seemed to absorb all sounds of Humans and movement and monument around them. Veroia was a medium-sized university, the only of its kind, as Professor Hagåtña had said, to “serve *all* species,” which was a misuse of the term ‘all’ but very common for humans to overstate their aims. It had no shortage of posters with faces of smiling humans and human-appearing aliens in *living fakes*, with their necks bent in awkward angles so that the *zilaa* signatory was obvious, the words “Earth’s first public institution integrating species in the same learning environment,” emblazoned as its caption. Veroia promised a more inclusive, diverse education; it was also the perfect place for Ks’ou to do their affairs more or less conspicuously as the Nation machine marched forward.
The campus was large enough so that it was easy to disappear as a student; the snow that fell on its campus only added to this effect. It was so quiet, in fact, that they almost didn’t hear the muffled cursing from across the courtyard. They stopped completely and stared as the two figures in navy enforcement suits, their ranks given away by the cotton-colored armband slashed with Ks’ou blue, wrestled with a blonde boy. They were dragging away a *Settled*s, a student she had recognized only briefly from the Ks’ou Deep. Enforcement had waited until he was in the POD and trapped; likely, Aurana ventured, he was being sent for reprimanding for some infraction. 

Ana was quiet. There were some words that didn’t need exchanging. They both agreed tacitly, for example, that the book they were writing for her capstone was a distraction from the other colonization that was happening—the global, quiet colonization, from the inside out.

Remnants from the war that Humans wrongly believed they’d won.

“But what about the Ks’ou?”

The entire class was staring at her, but Aurana didn’t care if she uttered the word that seemed so forbidden, as though not mentioning Ks’ou would somehow make that sore spot in Human history disappear. She glared back at the students: several were clearly *zilaa*, including the awkward boy with pepper hair, non-human and suppressed in the human-seeming encasements that *zilaa* were forced to wear. 

Yet most were Human: sleepy-eyed. Gangly. Apathetic—until it impacted their personal lives. Awhile ago Ana took offense at this description of her people until Aurana gave line-by-line evidence, and at that point Ana was ready to declare herself—though she couldn’t, really—not-fully-human. 

*What ABOUT the Ks’ou?* This was a nuance they needed to interrogate and the professor was deliberately dancing around the question.

“Yes, well,” Professor Jayco coughed and adjusted his glasses. He seemed to be a very nervous Human, with a fancy bald spot that seemed out of place with his youthful visage, dressed in a suit that seemed slightly too big for him. “It is true that the Ks’ou were known for stealing technology, though never for financial gain since the monetary system as we understand it is a Human invention.”

“So would you say Humans and Ks’ou alike share a history of stealing technology?” she pressed. Some of the Humans finally stirred in response to her words and glared at her, those who understood the point she was trying to make. 

“That might be… glossing over… details,” the professor said weakly. “Perhaps we can discuss this after class.”

{ Don’t slay him too hard, } Ana told her half-jokingly. { He looks like he went from diapers to degree. }

Aurana snickered internally. Aloud she said, “Perhaps. I merely want to press on the point that the sanctions on Humans for stealing technology from the *Thhiyatkhoor* and selling it for profit are marginal compared to the current sanction on Ks’ou. Technology-related deaths increase exponentially each year and we fail to address it because of our general preference for Humans as a species. We should analyze our personal biases when addressing crucial issues such as technological plagiarism.” 

“Nn-noted,” the professor squeaked. “I think we should continue with the lesson.”

But one of the *zilaa* boys—whose name she hadn’t bothered learning—spoke then. He was new, having just arrived in the middle of the semester only a couple weeks ago. His dark curls were entwined with a silver color that was not of his age, and long enough to hang over his ears but not his neck. It was usually the first thing both Ana and Aurana checked briefly with discerning eyes—smooth neck skin, prominently displayed, he was most certainly not Settled. Ana referred to his skin color as ‘ambiguous,’ whatever that meant. Like leather, his skin was brûlée. He tended to be quiet, so both Ana and Aurana were surprised when he offered the harsh, loud claim, “Are you a *Ks’ou* sympathizer?”

She glared at him, trying not to touch the scarf she always wore, a move which might bring unwarranted attention to her neck. A few other students murmured—in approval, it sounded—with this comment. This was a dangerous accusation. To be a Ks’ou sympathizer on Earth was nothing light; the few who existed had been silenced, often violently, so much so that the minority that remained no longer spoke openly. One of the mighty warriors of the first great battle on Earth against Ks’ou had been rumored to hold Ks’ou sympathies, but she no longer spoke publicly.
 
“I am merely asking *legitimate* questions. Unlike yours.” She snapped her head to challenge him with her eyes, eyes that told him to bring his best argument. His eyes, also brown, stared back at her widely, but not harshly. “Are humans beyond critique?” 

She had long suspected that he was *zilaa*—a non-Earther—just by the few remarks he would offer in class and his blatant misunderstanding of Humans. Once he’d claimed that Humans were all electronics-toilers, which was clearly false, even in the small metropolis they were in. Another time he’d referred to Humans as bipedals, a somewhat derogatory term if anyone thought about it long enough. 

Non-bipedal. That was all she knew of his species, but it wasn’t enough. There were monopeds and quadrupeds, and plenty more in between. Her own species, as water-born, did not even identify with this idea of ‘pedal’. For pedaled species, the default is to think in terms of feet. Wasn’t the mind just as sound?

“Of course not,” he finally said, his eyes flickering. “Humans earn critique as much as any species. By what measure do you critique them?”

This was a trap, she recognized. The measure she chose might reveal the fact that she was *zilaa*, too, or even her species, and of course she could not measure against atrocities that humans had committed against any species but her own. Her response would reveal what she was, and with that, who. 

So she raised her chin and said, “I measure us by our contribution to the universe. And so far we *humans* contribute much to those we identify as our own, and little to those we identify as our Other.” She’d hope the lie would pass, and for many in the public eye, it seemed to.

While he was unsatisfied with this response, the professor was now begging them to sit so they could finish their lesson before the next exam. Humans loved tiny tests that did not involve battle or blood, and it was perhaps a safer way to test one’s competence, but boring; nonetheless, they resigned. 

When class ended he seemed insistent on finishing the conversation. He followed close after her as she hurried out the door, “I have a book you should read, written by a *Thhiyatkhoor* General. It details—”

“What’s your name?” she interrupted sharply, then kept walking, heading towards the exit. She hoped that it had stopped snowing so that her Humans’ boots would survive the twenty minute walk.  

“Uh…” he reddened, as though unsure. They reached the double glass doors at the exit; here, her hopes for a ceased snowfall were dashed. She stopped pull her coat out of her bag as she waited for what should have had an immediate answer. 

“Ef.”

Aurana blinked, unsure if he was insane or trying to be funny as she pulled the coat over her shoulders.  The mop-haired boy shifted his bi-pedaled weight uncomfortably. 

She’d heard this, and repeated: “Elf?”

He heard the ‘l’, hesitated but realized this might be an advantage. ‘Elf’ over ‘Ef.’ “Yes. Elf. With an *l* like liquid. *Llllll*.” She stared; he continued talking. “It is longer, but I have been taught that I must truncate my name.”

She smirked. “Sure. But ‘Elf’ is a thing on this planet, a tiny and ridiculous creature. Do you not know?” His expression told her that he didn’t. “Perhaps El, then, might be a better fit. Just a suggestion, in case you don’t want too many to know you are *zilaa*.”

“Perhaps.” He—his engineered Human-appearing skin, rather—deepened crimson. “Pretty obvious?”

“Only just so,” she said, unsure that he picked up on the sarcasm. “I’ve read the book you mentioned, written by the Thhiyatkhoor General Shyridin? Spectacular storytelling, peppered with colorful myth. It is no wonder it reached the top of the Interstellar Bestseller list—pure stilled water.” He didn’t react so she continued, more firmly, “No Thhiyatkhoor should be trusted to write on the *Ks’ou*. Their two histories have been too violently entangled for too long.”

“I think that is exactly why they should be trusted with it.” He was stubborn, his words edged by a strange, soft kind of belligerence where he seemed to be arguing with no one but himself.

“Then would you tolerate a novel about the Thhiyatkhoor written by a Ks’ou?” she challenged.

He thought for a moment. “I could perhaps be bothered to read work by a Ks’ou sympathizer.” *What was he?* As she puzzled over his words, trying to find in her inventory a species to match, he caught her off guard, “For zilaa, you do a good job of holding humans accountable.”

“What makes you say that?” Aurana visibly sank into her scarf. She’d spoken a little too quickly, and was embarrassed to see El’s crooked smile, triumph she wanted to erase from his face with a quick blow. Ana mumbled a few words to her to calm her down. 

“Most Humans find me pretty intolerable within the first minute, but you somehow have continued talking to me.”

She stared at him for a moment; Ana was roaring with laughter and she was trying to hold her Human’s face straight. “I find you decently intolerable,” she said, looking away so that he couldn’t see her face for her long braids. “My name is Aurana.”

“I thought it was Ana?”

Hmm. So he listened in class more than he let on. “Yes. That is my truncated name, as yours.” She glanced outside; the snow gave no sign of letting up. Visitor’s Hours would be over if she didn’t hurry. “I do have to go.”

El nodded. “Tomorrow, after my *Ecology of Alien Invasions* class, maybe we can talk about General Shyridin’s book together. I’d like to hear more of what you disliked about it.” 

“Pffff,” there were many things about Humans that she liked. One of them was how you could make breathy sounds instead of using full words and still be understood; it was clear, however, by his blank expression that El wasn’t so well versed in that, either. No idioms, no sounds—how long had he been on this planet? She tugged on her scarf a bit so it hugged more tightly around her neck before she stepped out into the snow, “Sure. I have enough footnotes for a book of my own.”
