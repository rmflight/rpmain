![Ks'Sassi](/rpmain/img/kssassi_pronounciation.png)

### Overview

Ks'ou language, translinguated to the human tongue, largely relies on surdic consonants (uttered with the breath and not sound -(f, k, p, s, t), voiced plosives (d, g, b), and a few vowels (the most common are a, i, e). Occasionally contains dipthongs such as ‘aou’ and ‘iaa.’ Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) word order. 

**Notes**: 'Surd' is from the Latin word for deaf and mute. It is also where English gets the word 'absurd'.

### Grammar and Stats

Syntax: SVO word order, negation comes after the verb or clause

Make plural (4+) by adding 'ett, except plural (3): add 'ydoun; 2 is counted as singular

No genders, no verb 'to be'
