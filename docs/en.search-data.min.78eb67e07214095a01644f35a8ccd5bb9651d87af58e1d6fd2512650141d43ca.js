Humans, Earth-wide, would never be the same as before the Ks’ou arrived on Earth, and the nature of Ks’ou control would obliterate and disrupt Human-driven possibility. This has never before been made so clear as the introduction of the terms ‘Pre-Ks’ou Era’ (PKE) and ‘Post-Ks’ou Era’ (PsKE) in many Earth-published textbooks; though these terms are charged and used sparingly here, it should be noted that this work before you is written in 39 PsKE. The small years of the Ks’ou failed attempt at colonization will be simply referred to as ‘KE.’\nTo be sure, Humans were colonizers before the arrival of the Ks’ou.\nNot all Human colonization can be considered the same across all Human contexts. The title of this work is not to imply that ‘Human’ indicates an essential, singular form of colonization. That ‘Human’ serves as a metonym for ‘all’ or ‘universal’ is an unfortunate implication in some (though not the majority of) Human languages.\nThe purpose of my work is to explore the nature of Human-driven colonization across different geographical, political, and cultural contexts on the third planet from Sol (formerly the ambiguously named ‘Sun’) in the Human Solar System within the galaxy that Humans refer to as the Milky Way. By privileging the era of Human history before the Ks’ou arrival, when time was designated ‘CE’ or ‘AD’ and ‘BCE’ or ‘BC’, the authors aim to provide initial thoughts toward how Human colonization shaped the reaction towards subsequent Ks’ou colonization. Through the lens of the writers, the PKE can never fully be torn apart from the PsKE, though the former was never fully shaped by it, either. Across the galaxy, may we be comforted in the fact that all species share one trait: we are all the artifacts of our histories, whether we remember this history or not…\n"});index.add({'id':1,'href':'/rpmain/pages/constructed-languages/','title':"Constructed Languages",'content':"Constructed languages are crafted by the author, and therefore subject to human error.

Vowels coming soon.\n Overview #  Ks\u0026rsquo;ou language, translinguated to the human tongue, largely relies on surdic consonants (uttered with the breath and not sound -(f, k, p, s, t), voiced plosives (d, g, b), and a few vowels (the most common are a, i, e). Occasionally contains dipthongs such as ‘aou’ and ‘iaa.’ Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) word order.\nNotes: \u0026lsquo;Surd\u0026rsquo; is from the Latin word for deaf and mute.
